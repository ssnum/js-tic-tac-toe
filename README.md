# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that I built as a learning project for HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The game allows two players to take turns marking the cells in a 3x3 grid with their respective markers (X or O). The first player to get three of their markers in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.

## Features

- Play against another player using the same device
- Restart the game at any time.
- Visually appealing user interface with customizable colors.

## How to Play

1. Click on a cell in the game board to place your marker (X or O).
2. The game will automatically switch turns between Player 1 (X) and Player 2 (O).
3. Continue taking turns until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.
4. Click the "Restart" button to start a new game.

## Customization

You can customize the appearance of the game by modifying the CSS variables in the `<style>` tag of the `index.html` file. These variables control colors such as the background color, marker color, and winning cell color.
